## Description ##

The goal of this custom URL shortener is to provide even shorter short links to your site's pages. The setup of a URL shortener typically requires you to register your own domain name (something like goo.gl) and configure it to redirect to your primary domain (yourdomain.com). There are other ways to accomplish this, but that's the easiest and best way to use this URL shortener plugin.

After setting the base URL, any shortlinks generated by WordPress will use that URL rather than your primary domain.

## Installation ##

Installation is just a few steps:

1. Download, install, and activate the plugin through your preferred means.
2. Go Tools > URL Shortener and configure.
