=== WordPress Custom Short URL ===

Contributors: ryanboswell

Tested up to: 3.5 Single

== Description ==

The goal of this custom URL shortener is to provide even shorter short links to your site's pages. The setup of a URL shortener typically requires you to register your own domain name (something like goo.gl) and configure it to redirect to your primary domain (yourdomain.com). There are other ways to accomplish this, but that's the easiest and best way to use this URL shortener plugin.

After setting the base URL, any shortlinks generated by WordPress will use that URL rather than your primary domain.


== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go Tools > URL Shortener and configure

== CHANGELOG ==

= 1.0 =
* Initial Commit, add plugin info
* Create an options page for setting the custom base URL, add filter hook for replacing the primary site URL with the custom base URL, and add a deactivation hook to clean up after ourselves if the plugin gets deactivated or uninstalled.
* Add README
